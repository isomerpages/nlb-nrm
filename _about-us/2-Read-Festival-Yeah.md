Read! Fest 2019**’s theme of *Voyage* sails in tandem with the Bicentennial commemoration in Singapore – rediscovering the past with fresh perspectives while also looking to the future.

This year, we feature 130 programmes curated to topics revolving around Singlit past and present, the Singapore story retold, future narratives, and new thinking in a new world.

What’s more, the inaugural [**National Reading Challenge**](http://www.nationalreadingmovement.sg/challenge/) will launch during **Read! Fest**’s opening week. Read a book or two every week, and stand a chance to win attractive prizes!

Get ready for a journey beyond shores. **Read! Fest** is part of the National Reading Movement, which was launched in 2016 to encourage people to Read More, Read Widely and Read Together. Look out for ongoing reading-related initiatives that will stimulate a reading and learning culture across individuals and organisations.

This year’s Read! Fest key visuals were illustrated by Marina A. Inspired by the theme, *Voyage*, Marina incorporated foreign and local motifs to relay an inter-dimensional space journey where readers teleport themselves from reality to various reading worlds.

Marina A ([@mrn.a](https://www.instagram.com/mrn.a/)) is a Singapore based Multidisciplinary Visual Artist experienced in many different artistic mediums. Marina works predominantly in the medium of painting but includes digital art and installations in her repertoire. Her visual interpretations are usually influenced by astrophysics and her environment which involves the bending of reality in a surreal setting that creates a physical manifestation of the emotions that she wants to portray.
