## What is the National Reading Movement?
The National Reading Movement, which was launched in 2016, is a 5-year campaign by the National Library Board (NLB) to get Singapore residents to “Read More, Read Widely and Read Together”. It aims to encourage people to “Read More” by getting them to set aside some time to read regularly, “Read Widely” by going beyond the usual genres and read in mother tongue languages, and to “Read Together” with family and friends.

The Movement’s key priorities are to reach out to adults and seniors, promote reading in mother tongue languages and galvanise the community via collaborations – all with the aim to build a vibrant reading culture in Singapore.

## The Movement in 2020
In 2016, we encouraged Singaporeans to read more, by starting with little bits of reading. In 2016, NLB conducted the inaugural [National Reading Habits Survey](http://www.nlb.gov.sg/Portals/0/Docs/AboutUs/National%20Reading%20Habits%20Study_21%20Feb.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and found that 80% of Singapore residents were already reading more than once a week, be it books, magazines, news online or social media.

You can be a part of this movement by simply downloading eBooks via our NLB Mobile app, or visiting our public libraries, which offer a wide array of collections.

Let’s grow with every read and start by sharing a read #readingnationsg and tagging us at @readingnationsg.
