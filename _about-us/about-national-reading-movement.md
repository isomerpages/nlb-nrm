## What is the National Reading Movement?
The National Reading Movement (NRM) seeks to promote the joy of reading and learning in Singapore. Started in 2016 by the National Library Board (NLB), the movement aims to nurture a vibrant reading culture among the community, and set aside time to “Read More, Read Widely, Read Together”. 

This includes exploring new genres, discovering reads in our mother tongue languages and sharing them with family and friends.

## The Movement in 2022
In 2022, the National Reading Movement supports NLB’s LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025) efforts and engage in partnerships with key stakeholders to curate new ways for people to experience our collection of books and resources. The aim is to enrich everyone’s reading and learning journey and build towards an informed citizenry who read critically and deeply from a wide range of sources every day.
 
You can be a part of this movement by participating in our programmes, check out our some of the interesting titles via our NLB Mobile app, or visiting our public libraries, which offer a wide array of collections. You can also share a read on social media with #readingnationsg and tagging us at @readingnationsg.
 
If you would like to join in the Movement as an organisation, do email <NLB_NRM_PO@nlb.gov.sg> with the header <**National Reading Movement – Partnership**>.
