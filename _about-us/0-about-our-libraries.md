Kindly observe the Code of Conduct at our libraries:
This is our library where we read and learn together.
*Libraries are public and shared spaces.*
Share seats, power points and library materials with others.
Sleep at home, not in the library.
Do not bring in food or drinks, except for plain water.
*Please treat everyone with courtesy and respect.*
We will take action against any harassment of our staff or library patrons.
*Take care of your own belongings.*
We may remove unattended items.
*Libraries are quiet spaces.*
Speak softly at all times.
Use your phone outside the library.
Put electronic devices on silent mode.

Public disturbances will not be tolerated.

Thank you for your cooperation.
