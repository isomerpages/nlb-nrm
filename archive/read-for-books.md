Read for Books is a charity book drive with the intention of raising awareness of reading and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. From 11 to 26 July 2020, for every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries. We hope to raise 1,000 books for them.

Read for Books 2020 is supported by Scholastic Education International (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

*About the Beneficiaries*

**WondeRead**

The WondeRead initiative brings the library closer to children aged 7 – 17 years old from less privileged backgrounds, by providing reading opportunities through free reading materials. The initiative sees NLB working with Social Service Agencies (SSAs), such as charities and family service centres, to promote a love for reading among children.
