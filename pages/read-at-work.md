* Sharing by librarians about eResources such as Digital Business Library, PressReader, LinkedIn Learning for Library and Overdrive.
* Supplementary reading recommendations for Leaders as Reading Advocates, where we encourage our partners’ leaders and avid readers to share their favourite reads with colleagues.
