**Streets & Places Photo Gallery**

Get to see what Arab Street, North Bridge Road, and Market Street once looked like through these photos from the National Archives of Singapore. Palaniappan first sets up his textile business with Sivasu in 1964 at Market Street, before moving on to larger premises on Arab Street in the 1990s. You’ll even get to see what a *kittengi* on Market Street looks like – Sivasu gets his meals at a *kittengi* when he first arrives in Singapore.

**Market Street**



 “All Palaniappan’s company consisted of at that time was just a rented corner on the premises of a larger Chinese company called ‘Chu Hwa Enterprises’ on Market Street. All he had was a small wooden desk, a telephone and a rectangular plastic sign on the table that said ‘New Light Enterprises’. Fifteen dollars rent. That was all. Palaniappan had been twenty-four years old then.” (*page 15, Dharma’s Chariot*)

 

“…Sivasu had wandered across the river to Market Street and had been taken in as a casual labourer in a warehouse belonging to a Chettiar. There was no salary. They gave him food at their *kittengi*, a cross between a kitchen and a dining hall.” (*page 16, Dharma’s Chariot*)
