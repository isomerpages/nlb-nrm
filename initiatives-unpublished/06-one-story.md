**About the One Story project**

One Story is a multi-year project by the National Library Board (NLB) that makes local short stories - originally written in Tamil, Malay, Chinese, or English - available in other languages. The project aims to create a common literary conversation for everyone, regardless of language.

**About the Story**

Written by award-winning writer Sithuraj Ponraj, Dharma's Chariot is about Palaniappan, a cloth merchant, who sells a shipment of defective cloth to his old friend Jamal in order to pay the rent for his shop in Arab street. Jamal had helped him set up his business, and this act of cheating causes Palaniappan to feel guilty.
