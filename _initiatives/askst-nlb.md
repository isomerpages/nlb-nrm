As part of the National Reading Movement, NLB, in collaboration with The Straits Times, will be presenting a series of public talks called askST@NLB. Helmed by STâ€™s seasoned journalists, these free talks aim to encourage reading in a wide range of genres as well as foster discussions. Topics range from health to education to retirement.
