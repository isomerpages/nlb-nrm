<p><strong>The Smart Reader: The Best of Print and Screens</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>6 July 2024, Saturday, 10am – 11.30am</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading on screens is here to stay. We once thought the ubiquity of screens
with its accompanying distractions will kill our ability for deep immersed
reading. Thanks to the rallied efforts of reading experts and thinkers,
all hope is not lost as we have developed a better understanding of how
the digital medium affects how we read and how to manage them. Still, reading
print continues to be key in fostering critical skills. So how do we make
the best of both print and screen?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join Dr Annika Schwabe and Professor Ladislao Salmerón as they discuss
how we can build reading practices to optimise reading for both mediums,
including audiobooks.</p>

<p><strong>Readers &amp; Robot Writers: Open Chats on AI</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>13 July 2024, Saturday, 10am – 11.30am</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the internet and social media burst into the homes of the everyday
man, it was hard to foresee the impact it would have on the way we read.
Today, we have reached a new technological milestone with ChatGPT. Fears
of being tossed aside by sentient AI beings have renewed or started afresh.
But perhaps, the impact of AI could be more subtle than the extermination
of the human race. We could start with how AI could affect the way we read.
In this session, hear Author Stanley (Qiufan) Chen and Associate Professor
Dennis Yi discuss and speculate how AI will impact reading and literacy
in the future.</p>

<p><strong>New Gen Readers: Decoding Algorithms &amp; BookTok</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>20 July 2024, Saturday, 10am – 11.30am</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Long before reading became the quiet solitary experience we now know,
words were read aloud. And before they were scribed onto pages, stories
were passed through word-of-mouth. With BookTok and BookTube, reading has
made a comeback as a buzzing social activity, claiming space on our tweets
and feeds. This has helped create a vast community of readers online. How
has social media affect how we read? Is what we are reading shaped by invisible
forces of the algorithm? In this session, join Dr Federico Pianzola and
Associate Professor Simone Murray as they discuss the phenomena of social
reading today to help you become a discerning reader.</p>

<p><strong>The Ritual Effect: The Reader's Edition | RAD 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>27 July 2024, Saturday, 10am – 11.30am</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the age of endless distractions, habits and routines offer a semblance
of calm and consistency to our lives. However, as we engage in these tasks
repeatedly, we tend to switch to auto-pilot, carrying them out mindlessly
and thoughtlessly. Could this be why so many of us struggle to build a
consistent reading habit? In his book, The Ritual Effect, Dr. Michael Norton
writes about the benefits of shifting from a habitual to a ritualistic
mindset and how we can harness rituals to help add intentionality and pleasure
to our lives. Find out how we can apply this to building a reading ritual
by joining us for a talk with Michael himself!</p>
