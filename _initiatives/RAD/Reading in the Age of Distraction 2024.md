<p><strong>Read to Focus: The Art of Focused Reading in an Age of Distraction</strong>
</p>
<p>In an age of devices and distractions where focus is elusive, skim reading
is almost a given. We may be reading more, but are we really reading? Or
is the barrage of information that we consume all too transient? Join panellists
Professor Emerita Naomi Baron, Associate Professor Loh Chin Ee and moderator
Ibrahim Tahir, as they discuss how we are reading today, its understated
effects, how we can cultivate focused reading – and focus – in the age
of distraction.</p>
