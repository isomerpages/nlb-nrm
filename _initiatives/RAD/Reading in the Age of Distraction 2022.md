**About the One Story project**

One Story is a National Reading Movement initiative by the National Library Board to make Singapore short stories – originally written in Tamil, Malay, Chinese, or English – available in the other languages. The project aims to bring these stories to more readers beyond the language communities that they were originally written for. “Razi” is a short story by Dr Sa’eda Buang that was originally written in Malay. This book features the story in all four languages.
