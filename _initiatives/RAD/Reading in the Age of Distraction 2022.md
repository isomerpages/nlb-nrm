**Read to Focus: The Art of Focused Reading in an Age of Distraction**


In an age of devices and distractions where focus is elusive, skim reading is almost a given. We may be reading more, but are we really reading? Or is the barrage of information that we consume all too transient? Join panellists Professor Emerita Naomi Baron, Associate Professor Loh Chin Ee and moderator Ibrahim Tahir, as they discuss how we are reading today, its understated effects, how we can cultivate focused reading – and focus – in the age of distraction.

For some background reading for this session, do check out Naomi Baron's [How We Read Now](https://go.gov.sg/rad2022-howwereadnow) and Nicholas Carr's [The Shallows](https://go.nlb.gov.sg/m-link/details?type=ebook&id=16E7D9E4-C10C-4D3C-843B-5FB973E8FD76&utm_source=rad&utm_campaign=rad&utm_medium=bookrec).

**Read to Connect: The Importance of Reading Aloud for the Young and Old**


For much of history, reading was a rather noisy and communal activity. Today, it has evolved into a silent solitary activity, and reading aloud is mostly reserved for young children. In this session, join Dr Cyndi Giorgis, co-author of Jim Trelease’s [Read-Aloud Handbook](https://go.gov.sg/rad2022-thereadaloudhandbook), and Dr Jo Ann Netto-Shek as they discuss on the invigorating value of reading aloud to one another - even as adults, and how this practice can counter fractured attention spans in the age of distraction.

**Read to Retain: How to Take Smart Notes**


Have you spent hours poring over a book, only to forget what you read? According to geniuses from the likes of Benjamin Franklin to Richard Feynman, the trick to remember what we read is to read actively with a pen in hand and build a habit of note-taking. Hear from Dr. Sönke Ahrens, author of [How to Take Smart Notes](https://go.gov.sg/rad2022-howtotakesmartnotes) as he deconstructs the strategy of reading to retain.

**Read to See: Honing Your Skills of Perception through Art**


As we spend more time buried in our devices and our own worlds, are we losing touch with the art of observation and perception? Visual awareness allows us to better read people, places and situations. Join Amy E. Herman, author of [Visual Intelligence](https://go.gov.sg/rad2022-visualintelligence) , as she breaks down how we can hone our visual perception skills through art.
