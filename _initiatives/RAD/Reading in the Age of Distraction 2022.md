**Read to Focus: The Art of Focused Reading in an Age of Distraction**

**9 July 2022, Saturday, 10am – 11.30am**

In an age of devices and distractions where focus is elusive, skim reading is almost a given. We may be reading more, but are we really reading? Or is the barrage of information that we consume all too transient? Join panellists Professor Emerita Naomi Baron, Associate Professor Loh Chin Ee and moderator Ibrahim Tahir, as they discuss how we are reading today, its understated effects, how we can cultivate focused reading – and focus – in the age of distraction.

For some background reading for this session, do check out Naomi Baron's [How We Read Now](https://go.nlb.gov.sg/m-link/details?type=ebook&id=A478D448-6A2B-4E47-86BA-5B0EAF7913E4&utm_source=rad&utm_campaign=rad&utm_medium=bookrec) and Nicholas Carr's [The Shallows](https://go.nlb.gov.sg/m-link/details?type=ebook&id=16E7D9E4-C10C-4D3C-843B-5FB973E8FD76&utm_source=rad&utm_campaign=rad&utm_medium=bookrec).
