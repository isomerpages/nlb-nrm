**About the One Story project**

One Story is a National Reading Movement initiative to make Singapore short stories - originally written in Tamil, Malay and Chinese - available in the other languages. The project aims to bring these stories to more readers beyond the language communities that they were originally written for. *"Squat for Tradition, Sit for Modernity"* is a short story by Cultural Medallion recipient Chia Joo Ming that was originally written in Chinese. This book features the story in all four languages.


**Story Synopsis**

When the story's characters attempt to replace their squatting toilet with a sitting toilet bowl, they discover this will not be possible because their pre-war house is in a heritage conservation district and event its toilets are protected by regulations.

Cultural Medallion recipient Chia Joo Ming embeds this thwarted renovation attempt in a light-hearted story that ultimately poses the question to readers: "What do home, tradition and natural instinct mean to each of us?"
