Night at the Library is back with its fourth edition!

Partnering hyperlocal communities, this annual after-dark event, explores the collective belonging and self-image identities that we assume. Most of us live our lives in daylight but at night, stories and ruminations unfold.

Come along for blended experiential trails and explore through workshops and talks by writers, content creators, animators, photographers, forensic pathologists and astronomy clubs, unravelling the stories through the activities we engage in.

Erotic literature has existed for as long as our literary tradition, from Sappho, Catullus, Ovid, Shakespeare, to the modern day E. L. James. It is hard to fathom how words can even begin to describe the sensual pleasure of another person’s skin, but that is exactly what writers have been aspiring to contain within their words ever since humanity could put pen to paper. 

Join Balli Kaur Jaswal, Kayce Teo and Marylyn Tan as they chart the course of romance novels, from the conventional paperback stashed on the bookshelf of a lonesome romantic to the online collective of speculative fan-fiction.

Throughout history, star patterns in the night sky are given names woven with mythical stories, in what we now know as constellations. Learn about the constellations that are visible in Singapore’s night sky and the myths behind them at The Omni-Theatre and glean into the stories of Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia and Cepheus the King through a stargazing activity!

If the weather conditions are unsuitable for stargazing, participants will partake in a digital planetarium show in the Omni-Theatre instead.

This programme is a collaboration with the [Science Centre Singapore](https://www.science.edu.sg/) and [The Astronomical Society of Singapore (TASOS).](http://tasos.org.sg/about_tasos/about_tasos.html)

What tales lie beneath the skin of the deceased? When the body no longer has a voice to tell their story, the forensic pathologist steps in as interpreter. Deciphering the clues left behind, they piece the evidence to reconstruct the fatal narrative. 

Moderated by prolific crime thriller author and content creator, Neil Humphreys, join Liz Porter, David Ranson and Dr Lee Chin Thye as they demystify the craft of forensic pathologists - their lives, experiences, and the grisly bits in between. Pundits will share their slice of life, from day-to-day operations, morgue duties, and autopsies to determine the cause, manner and mechanism of death.

An Ode is a type of lyrical stanza. A formal, often ceremonious lyrical poem that addresses and often celebrates a person, place, thing, or idea.

Prolific poets Jennifer Anne Champion, Jedidiah Huang, Mok Zining and Low Kian Seh, celebrate Night at the Library with Ode to The Night, a writing workshop with poetry readings. 

Does the night offer a space for inspiration and creativity? Is night-time different in Singapore from other countries? Who are some poets of the night who inspire us and why?
