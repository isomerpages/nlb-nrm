**Read for Books**

Read for Books is a charity book drive to raise awareness and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. 

From 1 to 31 July 2023, for every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries, for up to approximately 9,200 books.

Read for Books 2023 is held in conjunction with Read! Fest. Find out more about Read! Fest here: [https://go.gov.sg/readfest23](https://go.gov.sg/readfest23)

**Beneficiaries**

**The WondeRead initiative** brings the library closer to children aged 7 – 17 years old from less privileged backgrounds, by providing reading opportunities through free reading materials. The initiative sees NLB working with Social Service Agencies (SSAs), such as charities and family service centres, to promote a love for reading among children. 

**kidsREAD** is a nationwide reading initiative by NLB in partnership with People’s Association, self-help groups, MOE schools and preschools and social service groups to promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among young Singaporeans, specifically children aged 4-8 years old from the less privileged families.

**Ready to READ @ NLB, *Starter kit & Programmes for Babies and Toddlers***_,_ is an initiative by NLB to reach out to parents of children aged 0 to 3 from the low-income families. This initiative provides parents with ready resources to kick-start positive reading habits with their children at home. NLB is collaborating with several organisations such as Early Childhood Development Agency (KidSTART), selected healthcare and preschool centres to provide these reading resources to them.
