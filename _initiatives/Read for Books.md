# **Beneficiaries**

**Calvary Community Care (C3)** is a registered charity and a member of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS).  As a multi-service social service agency, C3 serves children, youth, adults, and seniors through a range of holistic programmes that promote literacy, emotional well-being, and social connection.

For children, C3 offers GROW, iREAD, and StoryLAB - targeted literacy interventions supporting readers at various levels. Club TREASURE, an after-school programme for children from low-income families in Chai Chee, provides structured learning and holistic development. 

C3 engages youth-at-risk through its community-based youth centres (located in Marsiling and Tai Seng) and partnering MOE schools across the island. Through the drop-in and mentoring programmes, youths find belonging, develop resilience and learn practical life skills. 

C3 also offers quality and affordable counselling services for youths and young adults aged 12–40. 

For seniors in the Potong Pasir vicinity, C3 provides active aging activities to promote physical and social well-being and befriending services to combat social isolation. In partnership with NLB and other community partners, C3 delivers inclusive, impactful services across generations.

**kidsREAD** is a nationwide reading initiative by NLB in partnership with People’s Association, self-help groups, MOE schools and preschools and social service groups to promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among young Singaporeans, specifically children aged 4-8 years old from the less privileged families.

Grounded in the belief that all PWIDs have innate abilities and talents, MINDS is committed to empowering them and enhancing their quality of life, while advocating for greater inclusivity for PWIDs.
