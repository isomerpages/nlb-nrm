**About Night at the Library**

Night at The Library is back with its fourth edition!

Partnering hyperlocal communities, this annual after-dark event, explores the collective belonging and self-image identities that we assume. Most of us live our lives in daylight but at night, stories and ruminations unfold.

Come along for blended experiential trails and explore through workshops and talks by writers, content creators, animators, photographers, forensic pathologists and astronomy clubs, unravelling the stories through the activities we engage in.

**15 Nov 7.30pm - 9pm**
The Salaryman aspires to be more than his day job. Moderated by Charlene Shepherdson, join Benjamin Chee and Wayne Rée, co-creators of the prose-comic hybrid, _Work-Life Balance: Malevolent Managers and Folkloric Freelancers_, as they discuss suffocating work cultures, side hustles and the perennial balance between who you are and your company’s values. 

Learn more about the book _Work-Life Balance_ and get a sneak peek at the web browser game – _Internal Damnation: Pick Your Hell._ Through an interactive poll, join the audience as you collectively play as an intern at The Company. Try to impress your supervisors by fetching coffee, craft SEO-friendly social media posts and slog through other average office tasks.

Re-invent, DIY upskill and recalibrate work mindsets with curated reads too!

This programme is a collaboration with [Difference Engine.](https://differenceengine.sg/)

**15 Nov 7.30pm - 8.30pm**
Erotic literature has existed for as long as our literary tradition, from Sappho, Catullus, Ovid, Shakespeare, to the modern day E. L. James. It is hard to fathom how words can even begin to describe the sensual pleasure of another person’s skin, but that is exactly what writers have been aspiring to contain within their words ever since humanity could put pen to paper. 

Join Balli Kaur Jaswal, Kayce Teo and Marylyn Tan as they chart the course of romance novels, from the conventional paperback stashed on the bookshelf of a lonesome romantic to the online collective of speculative fan-fiction.

**The Stargazer 16 Nov**
Throughout history, star patterns in the night sky are given names woven with mythical stories, in what we now know as constellations. Learn about the constellations that are visible in Singapore’s night sky and the myths behind them at The Omni-Theatre and glean into the stories of Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia and Cepheus the King through a stargazing activity!

If the weather conditions are unsuitable for stargazing, participants will partake in a digital planetarium show in the Omni-Theatre instead.

This programme is a collaboration with the [Science Centre Singapore](https://www.science.edu.sg/) and [The Astronomical Society of Singapore (TASOS).](http://tasos.org.sg/about_tasos/about_tasos.html)
