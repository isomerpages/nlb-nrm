Life is no walk in the park, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun while we’re at it! 

This Read! Fest, we’re headed to the parks (and the libraries of course), literally. From **mid-July*  to 31 October 2021**, join us for an interactive literary trail that takes you through **East Coast Park, West Coast Park and National Library Building** in a multi-sensory reading experience like no other. 

Titled **The Curious Adventure of the Salaryman**, join digital protagonist Gerry as he navigates his own adventure to reinvent himself and disrupt his tiresome routine. Daring explorers will be invited to embark on journeys of self-discovery inspired by the festival theme of Reboot. 

Ready to go? All you’ll need is your smartphone, a good pair of shoes and a taste for the unexpected. 

<u>How to participate:</u>

Keep a lookout for the six colourful stations/installations onsite; you can begin the trail at any station by scanning the QR code on the installations. The entire trail can be completed within 30mins (inclusive of walking distance of ~5mins between the stations). For the full experience, make sure you start off at the first station! The first station for each venue is located in the following areas:
- East Coast Park: Near East Coast Lagoon Food Village
- West Coast Park: Near McDonald's West Coast Park
- National Library: At the Level 1 Plaza

***The public can access the trails at East Coast Park and West Coast Park from 23 July 2021, and the trail at National Library Building from 28 July 2021.**
