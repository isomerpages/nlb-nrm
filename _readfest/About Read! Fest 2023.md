**About Read! Fest 2023**

If you could steer how you move with the world, where would you go? Who would you want beside you? Exploring the concept of flourish, Read! Fest 2023 considers how we may thrive when we cast a line for what resonates with ourselves, relationships with people and spaces around us.

Anchored by 12 key titles, the festival is guided by the individual living in the current of rapid change, and a society bringing concerns from the margin towards the centre. 

For Read! Fest 2023, we bring books, conversations and experiences to you through author talks, thought-provoking panel discussions and hands-on workshops.

Through these, we ask: Whatâ€™s your kind of flourish?
