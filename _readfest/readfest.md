**About Read! Fest 2021**

A time of change is a time for reflection and growth. 

Read! Fest 2021 invites you to gaze inward with the theme: Reboot. While grappling with uncertainty, we are also pushed to question, seek and chart new paths for ourselves. What aspects have we overlooked in our day-to-day, and what demands too much of our attention? 

Anchored by 12 key books and topics, Read! Fest features talks, workshops and experiences by world-renowned authors and thought leaders from various fields. Take your pick from over 60 programmes and immerse yourself in thoughtful ideas prompted by challenging times. 

From myths and minimalism to work and womanhood, stretch out to explore new realms and perspectives. 

 

Where will you find yourself?
